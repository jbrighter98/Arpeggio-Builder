Thank you for using Chord and Arpeggio Builder!

This program began as a school project that was taken very 
seriously to give practicing guitarists and bassists a unique 
tool to help them hone their skills and knowledge of music 
theory. With our passion for guitar and bass, we took all the
things we found useful in different learning tools and combined 
them into one to help musicians learn music theory.

In case you were not aware, music theory is a very difficult 
topic to teach or learn. Even though this tool was made with 
the intent to teach theory, we are aware that being taught 
from another musician face-to-face is the best way to learn. 
This tool was made for people who want to learn but cannot 
afford the high price a music instructor or for people who DO have 
a music instructor but would like additional tools.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions, 
we would love to hear from you.
