# Arpeggio-Builder

To use this program, we recommend downloading all the files from the master branch, which is always the most user friendly version

Before downloading, make sure you have Python 3.7 (the latest version) installed on you device.

To download, click the "clone or download" button in the top right corner.
Then hit "Download ZIP".

After the zip folder has been downloaded, extract the files, all to the same location (preferably where your python scripts are stored).

After that, you should be good to go.
Just run try.py to start.
